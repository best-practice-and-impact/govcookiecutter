## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Definitions

Where this Code of Conduct says:

- "Project", we mean this `govcookiecutter` GitHub repository;
- "Maintainer", we mean the `best-practice-and-impact` organisation owners; and
- "Leadership", we mean both `best-practice-and-impact` organisation owners, line
  managers, and other leadership within the Office for National Statistics.

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and
maintainers pledge to make participation in our project, and our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability,
ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address,
  without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional
  setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor
for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an
individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
posting using an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by
contacting the project team at
[gsshelp@statistics.gov.uk][email-address]. All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may
face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the
project's leadership.
