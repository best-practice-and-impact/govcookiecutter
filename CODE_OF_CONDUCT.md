- "Leadership", we mean both `ukgovdatascience` organisation owners, line managers, and other leadership within the
  Government Digital Service.

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make
participation in our project, and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the
project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at
[gdsdatascience@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk][email-address]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and
will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated
to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement
policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent
repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
