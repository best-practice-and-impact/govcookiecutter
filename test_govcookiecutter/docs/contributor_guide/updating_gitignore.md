# Updating the `.gitignore` file

[The `.gitignore` used in this repository was created with generic exclusions from
gitignore.io][gitignore-io], with project-specific exclusions listed afterwards.

If you want to add exclusions for new programming languages and/or IDEs, use the first
line to recreate the generic exclusions from gitignore.io. Add all other
project-specific exclusions afterwards.
