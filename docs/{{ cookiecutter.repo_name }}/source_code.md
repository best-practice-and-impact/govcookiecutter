# `{{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '_').replace('-', '_') }}` folder overview

This is where source code for the created project is stored. We recommend following a standard Python project structure,
with functions grouped into modules inside a descriptively named folder. The created repository contains an `example_module.py`
inside the `example_modules` folder. These can then be imported into a main script, such as `run_pipeline.py`.
