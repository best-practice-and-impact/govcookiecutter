# `hooks` API reference

This page gives an overview of all public `hooks` objects, functions and methods. All
classes and functions exposed in `hooks.*` namespace are public.

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: hooks
```

## Cookiecutter pre-generation hooks

These are functions run after user input, but before project generation. If any
pre-generation hooks fail, the project will not be generated.

## Cookiecutter post-generation hooks

These are functions run after initial project generation by the `cookiecutter`
package. These include moving the selected organisational frameworks to the correct
location, as well as deleting unnecessary files and folders. If any post-generation
hooks fail, the generated project will be rolled-back, and deleted.
