# `docs` folder overview

All documentation for the project should be included in this folder in MyST Markdown
files, with acceptable formatting for Sphinx. [Guidance on how to write Sphinx
documentation is supplied in the contributor guide][writing-sphinx-documentation].

If you want to include any documentation written in the `{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`
folder without duplicating it, include it in the `docs/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`
folder.

To build the documentation, run the `docs` command [from `Makefile` using the `make`
utility at the top-level of this repository][docs-makefile].

```shell
make docs
```

or, alternatively, run:

```shell
sphinx-build -b html ./docs ./docs/_build
```

The HTML-version of this documentation can then be viewed at `docs/_build/index.html`,
relative to the top-level of this repository.
