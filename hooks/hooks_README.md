# `hooks` folder overview

This folder contains any pre- and post-generation hooks used by the `cookiecutter`
Python package. These are used to customise the created repository based on the
user's requirements, and perform automated tasks such as removing folders.

Full documentation on pre- and post-generation hooks is available in
the [`cookiecutter` documentation][cookiecutter-hooks].
