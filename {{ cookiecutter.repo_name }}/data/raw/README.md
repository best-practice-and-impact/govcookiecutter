# Raw Data

This folder is for **original, immutale datasets**.

- Put source data here exactly as you received it
- Do **not** edit, clean, or transform files in this folder
- Treat these files as **read-only**: if you need to make changes, copy them into `../interim/` or `../processed/` instead.

This ensures:

- You always have a reliable record of the original data,
- Your analysis can be reproduced from the same starting point, and
- Mistakes can be traced back to their original source.
