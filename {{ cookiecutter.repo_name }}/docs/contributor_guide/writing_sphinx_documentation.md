# Writing Sphinx documentation

[This project is set up to produce documentation using Sphinx][sphinx]; this page
should give you a quick overview on how to write documentation for it. If you'd like to
know how to write good documentation take a look at [Write the Docs guide on writing
documentation][writethedocs]. [For Agile projects, consider documenting
late][agilemodeling] as well.

## Why should I bother? And why Sphinx?

Keeping as much of the documentation in a centralised location is a good thing. It
means contributors, users, and anyone else can quickly find as much information as they
need to understand and/or run what you've done.

Sphinx is a Python-based package to compile documentation into different formats,
including HTML. This means you can write your documentation and, with a single terminal
command, build it into a searchable website.

It's widely used, such as for the documentation of the [`pandas`][pandas], and
[PyTorch][pytorch] Python packages as well as many [others][sphinx-examples]. It is
highly customisable with different extensions, and themes. Included with this project
is:

- support for both [reStructuredText (ReST)][sphinx-rest], and [ReST-enabled
  Markdown][myst];
- automatic building of documentation from Python docstrings; and
- support for [ReStructuredText][docstring-rst], [NumPy][docstring-numpy], or
  [Google][docstring-google] docstring formats.

### Creating a searchable website

To create a website with your documentation, run the following command in your terminal
at the top-level of this project:

```shell
make docs
```

This should create an HTML version of your documentation accessible from
`docs/_build/index.html`.

## Writing in reStructuredText

[Sphinx provides good documentation on writing in ReST][sphinx-rest] â€” we would highly
recommend reading that for guidance. We will cover automatically creating docstrings in
the next subsection.

### Automatically creating docstring documentation (ReST)

Let us say that `src/__init__.py` has functions called `hello` and `world` imported
into it, and both have docstrings. To automatically generate docstring documentation,
create a ReST file, and add the following line to reference the `src` module:

```rest
.. currentmodule:: src
```

Then, elsewhere in the body, [call the `autosummary` directive to generate the
docstrings as ReST stub files][sphinx-autosummary].

```rest
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api/

    hello
    world

```

[This will create something similar to the `pandas` API
reference][pandas-api-reference].

## Writing in ReST-enabled Markdown

[We use the `myst-parser` package (MyST) to write Markdown that can also include ReST
elements][myst]. The package documentation is detailed, so we would recommend reviewing
it. We will cover some of the more widely used elements in the following subsections.

### Embedding ReST directives

[Most ReST directives can be embedded into MyST Markdown][myst-rst-directives].

### Automatically creating docstring documentation (MyST Markdown)

Let us say that `src/__init__.py` has functions called `hello` and `world` imported
into it, and both have docstrings. To automatically generate docstring documentation,
create a Markdown file, and add the following line to reference the `src` module:

````md
```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: src
```
````

Then, elsewhere in the body, [call the `autosummary` directive to generate the
docstrings as ReST stub files][sphinx-autosummary].

````md
```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: api/

    hello
    world

```
````

### Including Markdown files outside the `docs` folder

[MyST lets you include Markdown files outside the `docs` folder][myst-include].

If a Markdown file (`../example.md`) only contains links that do not reference anything
else in this project (including images), create a Markdown file within the `docs`
folder with the following lines:

````md
```{include} ../example.md
```
````

However, if it includes relative links referencing other files in this project
(including images), we need to tell MyST what those links actually refer. For example,
if the relative link is `../hello/world.md`, we need to create a Markdown file within
the `docs` folder with the following lines:

````md
```{include} ../example.md
:relative-docs: ../hello
:relative-images:
```
````
