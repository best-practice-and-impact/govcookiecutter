### Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation

body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open,
welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people;
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences;
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback;
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience;
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind;
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;
- Public or private harassment;
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission;
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are expected to raise any instances of unacceptable behaviour to
project leadership.

Project leadership are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour. They also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor
for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an
individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
posting using an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project leadership.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by
contacting the project team at [][email-address]. All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may
face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by members of the
project's leadership.
