welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people;
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences;

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;
- Public or private harassment;
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission;
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are expected to raise any instances of unacceptable behaviour to
project leadership.

Project leadership are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behaviour. They also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor
for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,
posting using an official social media account, or acting as an appointed

further defined and clarified by project leadership.

### Enforcement

contacting the project team at [][email-address]. All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of
specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may
face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by members of the
project's leadership.
