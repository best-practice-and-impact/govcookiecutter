## Top-level files

Each subsection here contains a brief description about the files at the top-level of this Git repository.

### `.coveragerc`

A file containing configuration settings for the [`coverage`][coverage] Python package. When executed with
[`pytest`][pytest] using the following command:

```shell
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
```

a code coverage report in HTML will be produced on the code in the `src` folder. This HTML report can be accessed at
`htmlcov/index.html`.

### `.envrc`

A file containing environment variables for the Git repository that can be selectively loaded. This uses the
[`direnv`][direnv] shell extension; see their documentation for further information.

This file contains a `sed` command to output a `.env` file with all the environment variables. This may be useful for
sourcing environment variables, for example in conjunction with PyCharm's EnvFile plugin.

To ensure this `sed` command works correctly, make sure any file paths listed in this file, and the
[`.secrets`](#secrets) are absolute file paths (recommended), or relative file paths using other environment variables
(works for Python users only). Environment variable names can only contain letters, numbers or underscores as well. For
example:

```shell
export DIR_DATA=$(pwd)/data  # fine for Python and R users
export DIR_DATA_EXTERNAL=$(pwd)/data/external  # fine for Python and R users
export DIR_DATA_EXTERNAL=./data/external  # fine for Python and R users
export DIR_DATA_EXTERNAL=$DIR_DATA/external  # fine for Python users only
export DIR-DATA-EXTERNAL=$DIR_DATA/external  # will break the `sed` command!
```

### `.flake8`

A configuration file for the [`flake8`][flake8] Python package that provides linting. This file is based on the
[common configuration][gds-way-flake8] described on [The GDS Way][gds-way].

### `.gitignore`

A `.gitignore` file to ignore certain files and folders from this Git repository. See the
[contributor guide][docs-updating-gitignore] for further information about modifying this file.

### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

A pre-commit hook configuration file. See the [contributor guide][docs-pre-commit-hooks] for further details.

### `.secrets`

A file to store all secrets and credentials as environment variables. This is read-in by [`.envrc`](#envrc) using the
[`direnv`][direnv] shell extension, but is **not** tracked by Git.

### `.secrets.baseline`

Baseline file for the [`detect-secrets`][detect-secrets] package; this package detects secrets, and, in conjunction
with `pre-commit`, prevents them from being committed to the repository. The baseline file flags secret-like data that
the user deliberately wishes to commit the to repository.

### `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

The [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct] for contributors to this project, including maintainers and
`{{ cookiecutter.organisation_handle }}` organisation owners.
