# Analytical quality assurance plan

This analytical quality assurance (AQA) plan outlines our implementation of the [Aqua Book](
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government) for
this project.

This is a **living** document, and should be updated and/or modified as necessary, e.g. if new tasks not listed here
become relevant to project success, please add them to this plan.
