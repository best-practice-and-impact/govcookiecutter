# `docs` folder

All documentation for the project should be included in this folder in either reStructuredText or Markdown files, with
acceptable formatting for Sphinx.

To build the documentation, run the `docs` command from the [`Makefile`][docs-makefile] using the `make` utility at the
top-level of this Git repository.

```shell
make docs
```

Guidance on how to write Sphinx documentation is supplied in the [contributor guide][writing-sphinx-documentation].

## Analytical quality assurance (AQA)
