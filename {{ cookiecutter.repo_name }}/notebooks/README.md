# `notebooks` folder

All Jupyter notebooks should be stored in this folder. The [`.envrc`][docs-envrc] file
should automatically add the entire project path into the `PYTHONPATH` environment
variable — this should allow you to directly import `src` in your notebook.

[docs-envrc]: ../docs/structure/README.md#envrc
