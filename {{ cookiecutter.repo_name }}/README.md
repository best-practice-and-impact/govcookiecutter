{% endif -%}
- A `.secrets` file with the [required secrets and
  credentials](#required-secrets-and-credentials)
- [Load environment variables][docs-loading-environment-variables] from `.envrc`

To be added.

## Required secrets and credentials

To run this project, you need a `.secrets` file with secrets/credentials as
environmental variables; see the
[documentation][docs-loading-environment-variables-secrets] for further guidance. The
secrets/credentials should have the following environment variable name(s):

| Secret/credential | Environment variable name | Description                                |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Secret 1          | `SECRET_VARIABLE_1`       | Plain English description of Secret 1.     |
| Credential 1      | `CREDENTIAL_VARIABLE_1`   | Plain English description of Credential 1. |

Once you've added these environment variables to `.secrets` you will need to
[load them via `.envrc`][docs-loading-environment-variables].
