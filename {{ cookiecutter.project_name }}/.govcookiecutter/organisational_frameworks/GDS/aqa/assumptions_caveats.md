# Assumptions and caveats log

This log contains a list of assumptions and caveats used in this analysis.

## Definitions

Assumptions are RAG-rated according to the following definitions for quality and
impact[^1]:

[^1]: With thanks to the Home Office Analytical Quality Assurance team for these definitions.

| RAG   | Assumption quality                                                                                                              | Assumption impact                                                                           |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Green | Reliable assumption, well understood and/or documented; anything up to a validated & recent set of actual data.                 | Marginal assumptions; their changes have no or limited impact on the outputs.               |
| Amber | Some evidence to support the assumption; may vary from a source with poor methodology to a good source that is a few years old. | Assumptions with a relevant, even if not critical, impact on the outputs.                   |
| Red   | Little evidence to support the assumption; may vary from an opinion to a limited data source with poor methodology.             | Core assumptions of the analysis; the output would be drastically affected by their change. |
