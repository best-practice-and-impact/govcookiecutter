# Contributing

We love contributions! We've compiled this documentation to help you understand our contributing guidelines. If you
still have questions, please [contact us][email] and we'd be happy to help!

## Code of Conduct

Please read [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`][code-of-conduct] before contributing.

## Getting started

To start contributing, first ensure your system meets the [requirements][readme-requirements-to-create-a-cookiecutter-template]. Next, install the
required Python packages, and [pre-commit hooks][pre-commit] using:

```shell
make requirements
```

It is better to use the above make command, rather than `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pre-commit install`, as
the command will ensure your pre-commit hooks are up-to-date with any changes made.

The pre-commit hooks are a security feature to ensure no secrets, large data files, and output cells of Jupyter
notebooks are accidentally committed into the repository. For more information about the pre-commit hooks used in this
repository, see the [documentation][docs-pre-commit-hooks].

## Code conventions

We mainly follow [The GDS Way][gds-way] in our code conventions.

### Git and GitHub

We use Git to version control the source code; please read [The GDS Way][gds-way-git] for further details, including
information about writing good commit messages, using `git rebase` for local branches, and `git merge --no-ff` for
merges, as well as the entry on `git push --force-with-lease` instead of `git push -f`.

If you want to modify the `.gitignore` files, see the template [documentation][docs-updating-gitignore] for further
details.

Our source code is stored on GitHub at [https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govcookiecutter][govcookiecutter]. Pull
requests into `master` require at least one approved review.

### Python

For Python code, we follow [The GDS Way Python style guide][gds-way-python] with a line length of 120; the flake8
pre-commit hook should help with this!

### Markdown

Local links can be written as normal, but external links should be referenced at the bottom of the Markdown file for
clarity. For example:

```md
Use a local link to reference the [`README.md`](./README.md) file, but an external link for [GOV.UK][gov-uk].

[gov-uk]: https://www.gov.uk/
```

We also try and wrap Markdown to a line length of 120 characters, but this is not strictly enforced in all cases, for
example with long hyperlinks.

## Testing

Tests are written using the [pytest][pytest] framework, with its configuration in the `pytest.ini` file. Note, only
tests in the `tests`, and `{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/tests` folders are executed. To run the tests, execute the
following command in your terminal:

```shell
pytest
```

### Code coverage

Code coverage of Python scripts is measured using the [`coverage`][coverage] Python package; its configuration can be
found in `.coveragerc`. Note coverage only extends to Python scripts in the `hooks`, and
`{{ cookiecutter.repo_name }}/src` folders.

To run code coverage, and view it as a HTML report, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
```

The HTMl report can be accessed at `htmlcov/index.html`.

## Documentation

We write our documentation in [MyST Markdown][myst] for use in Sphinx. This is mainly stored in the `docs` folder,
unless it's more appropriate to store it elsewhere, like this file.

Further information on how to write Sphinx documentation, and how to build it into a searchable website can be found
[here][docs-write-sphinx-documentation].
